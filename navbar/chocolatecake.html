        continent is also known for
        producing some of the best coffee beans in the world.

        With its world-renowned quality and unique flavors. African coffee should definitely be on the list to try for
        any
        coffee drinker. The question is which one should you pick?

        Keep reading to find our choices for the Best African Coffee and find out why it deserves its revered
        reputation.
        Nonetheless, If you’re in a hurry, here’s our top pick: Much of Africa lies across the “bean belt” which has the
        perfect growing conditions for coffee. Coffee production is
        situated along the African Great Lakes, where fertile soil, cool climate, and numerous highlands makes it ideal
        for
        cultivating the Arabica coffee species.

        This region is known for producing one of the fruitiest coffees in the world. African coffees are typically
        characterized by bright acidity with wine-like, floral, and fruity flavors. This can range from citrus, berries,
        bergamot, and even hints of jasmine.

        Coffee experts have long since recognized Ethiopia and Kenya for their premium-quality, specialty grade coffee
        varieties
        such as Typica, SL-28, Kenya AA coffee, and the famed Gesha varietal.

        Countries such as Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Burundi also produce uniquely flavored coffees and are steadily
        placing
        high for specialty coffee lovers. Other regions, including Côte d’Ivoire and Uganda produce mainly Robusta
        varieties.
        Delicate and sweet with a tart profile. Expect to get overtones of strawberry, pineapples, and guava with just a
        hint of
        dark chocolate and toasted coconut taste to balance out its acidity. It’s also organically certified and
        fair-trade to
        ensure you’ll be getting the best beans available.

        Its medium-light profile is best brewed with a pour-over if you’re after a light cup or with a French Press if
        you
        prefer a fuller-bodied experience.

        With that said, Volcanica Coffee’s Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee is a must-try whether you’re an experienced
        coffee
        drinker or for your first foray into more exotic beans. I recall this single-origin was my entry into for fruity
        coffees!<strong>While Congo might not be as well-known for growing African coffee than others, they export good
            quality Arabica with
            unique and exciting flavors.
