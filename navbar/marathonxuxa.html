    <h2>Marathon xuxa</h2>
        <p style="width:70%">Hello, Besties! Welcome back to yet another episode  on Sizzles Diaries. 
        Village is known by different names across the globe, but here in Namibia the common
        name is Marathon chicken. It is known by that name because of the reference given 
        to how hard it is to chase after it inorder to catch the chicken. This particular
        chicken is prepared differently across Namibia, however one thing we all share in common 
        is the lenght time it is cooked.Marathon chicken is a free roaming bird that feed on mostly
        grains ( pearl millet, sorghum, crushed maize, black eye beans, sunflower seeds and marula 
        nut shells) as well as ants, wild berries and leafy greens. It has thick flesh and dense 
        bones which greatly influence how its cooked. It has to be boiled in a mixture of salt ,spices
        and traditional aromatics  for two hours or more. The immense flavour is derived from 
        the sauce which is developed when boiling over a prolonged period.  Marathon chicken is often 
        prepared only on special ocassions, so it is served whole without the afval 
        (head, feet, neck, liver and gizzards) and with little sauce a cup of maroela oil and mahangu
        porridge.  Traditionally it is served in etiti while the porridge in elilo, four or more guest 
        seat arround the table enjoying marathon chicken. The correct table etiquette when 
        eating marathon chicken is that the guest gets to divide the chicken then taking 
        a piece and giving a chance to the rest to take a piece, children must be given 
        a piece by the senior at the table. marathon chicken is enjoyed eating with your 
        hands, so make sure they are washed and your nails are trimmed. If you like to see 
        me film about a particular topic of interest, kindly send me an email, I'd love to hear 
        from you. </p>
